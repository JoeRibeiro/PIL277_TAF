## Quality of the assessment


```{r echo=FALSE, width = 300, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis',fig.keep='all'}

writeLines(paste0("This stock was benchmarked in ",as.character(EndYear)," and the ICES framework for category 3 short-lived stocks using the 1-over-2 rule with
an uncertainty cap of 80% and a biomass safeguard (ICES, 2020a) was considered appropriate to provide advice. Since it is
the first application of the framework, the initial catch in the rule is taken from the mean of the catch from the previous
two years (",as.character(EndYear-2),"–",as.character(EndYear-1),"). A SPiCT model based on quarterly landing data and a biomass index derived from the core area of
the acoustic survey PELTIC was considered inadequate to provide advice but is used to approximate stock status relative to
MSY reference points.\n
French catches from ICES rectangles 25E5 and 25E4 (Subarea 7) have been traditionally allocated to Division 8.a, as they
occur in the boundary between divisions and are considered to be more closely associated with the sardine stock in
divisions 8.a-b and 8.d. However, the boundary between sardine stocks in subarea 7 and 8 is unclear and further studies
are needed to support this procedure to allocate catches"))

Figure 2: Sardine in subarea 7. SPiCT analysis showing exploitable biomass relative to BMSY and fishing mortality relative to FMSY.
The biomass index used was derived from the core area of the acoustic survey PELTIC. The shaded areas in both plots
indicate 95% confidence intervals. The horizontal lines indicate levels relative to the FMSY and BMSY.


## Issues relevant for the advice


```{r echo=FALSE, width = 300, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis',fig.keep='all'}

writeLines(paste0("The 1-over-2 rule performs the best when there is no time-lag between the survey producing the biomass estimate and
the TAC implementation (ICES, 2020c). This is especially important for short-lived species, as part of the observed stock
will not be available for the fishery when there is a large lag in time. The PELTIC survey is conducted in October and the
biomass estimate is already incorporated in the catch advice for the following year, with a time-lag of only two months.
The advice for this stock in 2019 was provided for two years since this was a Category 5 stock at the time. As
from 2020 the stock is Category 3, and given that a new biomass estimate is available every year catch advice could be
provided annually."))
